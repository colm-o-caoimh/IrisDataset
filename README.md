Final project Programming and Scripting 2020

## Data search and download
* Following a quick Google search, I established that the Iris data set is used widely
in the fields of machine learning and statistics. It is referenced in
numerous academic publications, student projects, online tutorials etc. so there
was no shortage of sources offering the file for download. The most commonly 
referenced source appeared to be the UCI (University of California Irvine) website,
whose machine learning repository offers the data set for download, amongst many others.
It is this source that I have used in this project.

* It is important to mention that the UCI data set differs slightly from the data 
presented in Fisher's original paper. This is noted on the website.

## Iris data set
* The data was collected by Edgar Anderson and introduced by Ronald A. Fisher in his
paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" in 1936. According
to the UCI website, the paper "... is a classic in the field [of pattern recognition]
and is referenced frequently to this day"

* A multivariate data set, it contains a total of 150 instances consisting of 50 instances
of each of 3 classes: *Iris-setosa*, *Iris-virginica* and *Iris-versicolor*. These refer
to 3 different species of the iris flower. There are 4 attributes in the sample: *sepal length*,
*sepal width*, *petal length* and *petal width*, referring to the parts of each flower
measured by Anderson.
